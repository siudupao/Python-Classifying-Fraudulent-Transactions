# Python-Classifying-Fraudulent-Transactions

Project Overview
---
In this project, I analyze financial transaction data to explore patterns of fraudulent behaviour. Upon obtaining a set of features that correlate with whether a transaction is fraudulent or valid, I train the machine learning algorithms RandomForestClassifier and ExtremeGradientBoosting to classify and predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. I evaluate these models using  Confusion Matrix, Classification Report and AUC.

Dataset
--
The dataset used for this project is called [Synthetic Financial Datasets For Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1?page=2]) from Kaggle.

The dataset is a synthetic dataset generated based on real mobile money transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. This dataset was generated specifically for fraud detection research.
