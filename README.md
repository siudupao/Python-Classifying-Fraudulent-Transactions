# Python-Classifying-Fraudulent-Transactions

Project Overview
---
In this project, I analyze financial transaction data to explore patterns of fraudulent behaviour. 

EDA 
- time of transaction
- payment type
- amount of transaction
- account type
- account balance
- flagged transaction

Once I obtain a set of features that correlate with fraudulent data, I train the machine learning models RandomForest and ExtremeGradientBoost to classify and predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
